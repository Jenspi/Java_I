Howdy!

ArtMuseum is a program that allows the user to explore (you probably guessed it) an art museum.

The Room class is specifically for creating, setting, and retrieving room objects and their exits. Museum creates the art museum object itself, and ArtMuseum is the runner class.

To compile and run the program, have all three files in one directory and run the following commands in your terminal:
> javac *.java
> java ArtMuseum

Additional Comments:
1.) User can jump through windows in three different rooms but cannot jump back in once outside.
2.) Didn't make setNorth, setSouth, setEast, or setWest methods as I used setExits to set all four at once.
