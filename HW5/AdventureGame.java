		roomInfo[1] = "Welcome to the front hall! There are pictures of the family from different periods of time, even James' ex girlfriend. James had two kids with her so we kinda can't take them down at this point.";
		roomInfo[2] = "Here is my mom and dad's room, a.k.a. the place everyone gathers to talk about random crap for hours at a time. There's window AC in here, so it's always negative two degrees.";
		roomInfo[3] = "This is James' room. I lived in this room before him, and way before that it was a garage. It's basically the size of my parents' room if not bigger. The attic door always scared me and the shade on my lamp melted from me sleeping with the light on so I wouldn't be attacked by attic demons.. so I downsized.";
		roomInfo[4] = "Here is the kitchen.. Long story short, the walls are painted yellow and the floor is white and blue. Just throw the whole kitchen away.";
		roomInfo[5] = "This is my parents' bathroom area. It's probably the same amount of square feet as my room alone. Back in the MySpace days, my parents kept our family PC in here. That should give you an idea of how big it is. (The bathroom itself has a door, so it's a little weird but not that weird)";
		roomInfo[6] = "This is the second hallway! This hallway merges with the front hall and has a big clock in in. I don't even know where it came from and my niece opens the door and presses her face against it all the time.";
		roomInfo[7] = "Here is \"the hall bath\". This bathroom has been pale blue, lime green, etc. but is now a boring tan color. You can tell my parents let us pick the colors growing up.";
		roomInfo[8] = "This is the dining room. James' current girlfriend is a mega talented artist, so there's artwork all over the walls. We have a kitchen table that doesn't get used by anyone except me + my niece and nephew.";
		roomInfo[9] = "This is the living room. One time we had a nice entertainment center with glass cabinets, but Jonas was messing with my grandma's motorized wheelchair and drove straight into it.";
		roomInfo[10] = "Here is my room! This was my room a long time ago (I've lived in every room except my parents'), then it was my grandma's, then I moved back in. All of my walls except one are grey, and the last one is purple. My grandma loved purple so I figured I'd keep one to remember her, but not all of them since the carpet and curtains are purple as well and it looked weird.";
