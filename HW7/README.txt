Hello!

This is a continuation of my HW6 program. I'm not necessarily proud of it as I underestimated the amount of time it would take me to do it, but I like the outcome.

To compile and run the program, have all files in one directory and run the following commands in your terminal:
> javac *.java
> java ArtMuseum
