Howdy!

Combinations is an algorithm that finds the number of possible groups of four at a party of one hundred people.

To compile and run: type "javac Combinations.java" to compile, and "java Combinations" to run the program. You should only get a line of text back that tells you how many groups are possible, as I am too swamped with midterms to do anything cooler at the moment (sad face).

bonus1: I've also included bonus1 to find how many conversation groups of five are possible at the same party. "javac bonus1.java" compiles it, while "java bonus1" will run it.
