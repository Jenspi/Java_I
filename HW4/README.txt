Greetings!

VirtualPet is a program that allows the user to take care of a virtual kitten. The user is able to name and take care of the kitten, and find out how they did at the end. If played more than once, a list of all pets will be displayed once the user is done playing.

To compile and run the program, type "javac VirtualPet.java" into your terminal, followed by "java VirtualPet" once the first command has run.
