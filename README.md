### HW1: Hello World!
The typical "Hello World!" code.

### HW2: Higher/Lower
A program that guesses a number (you think of one first); if the computer is wrong, you tell it that your number is higher or lower until it guesses correctly. This assignment taught us how to intake & process user input, how to use while loops, and how to implement if/else statements.

### HW3: Combinations
Hard-coded program finding the number of ways one hundred people can be put into a group of four. A bonus file that does the same, but with five people instead. Although it's not the best way to go about this problem, this assignment was to get us familiar with for loops.

### HW4: Virtual Pet
A tamagotchi-style program where you "find" a kitten, name it, and then take care of it. I chose for the animal to be a kitten based on my beloved cat, June (I'm writing this readme four years post-assignment, and she has since passed away around two years ago. It warmed my heart to see that I included my dad's nickmane for her in my code, so I wanted to mention it here). The program keeps tracks of all of all statistics and pets that you find. This assignment had us practice arrays, constant variables, and implementing & calling our own written methods.

### HW5: Adventure Game
A dungeon game based completely off of my family home, with little details that may or may not be true til this day. This assignment was simply to implement our understanding of multidimensional arrays.

### HW6: Art Museum
The user travels through an art museum, where each room has its own description. Hidden features, such as exiting through a window but not being able to enter back in that same way. We learned how to make use of more than one class.
