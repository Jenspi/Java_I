(HW2)Fourth refinement of Pseudocode:
Initialize an int variable that represents the lowest possible number to 0
Initialize an int variable that represent the highest possible number to 100
Initialize a Boolean variable, which represents if we’ve achieved the correct guess, to false
Initialize an int variable, where we store the number of guesses we’ve made, to 0
Declare an int variable in which to store an initial guess
Declare an int variable to store user input
Initialize a Scanner object and name the variable you assign it to “input”

Prompt the user to choose a number

Make an initial guess and store it.
Increment the value in the variable storing number of guesses.

Present guess to the user
Present prompt to user (“Enter 1 if this was a correct guess, 2 if your number is higher, and 3 if your number is lower:”)

While we haven’t guessed the correct number (correctGuess == false)
	Use Scanner to grab the nextInt() the user types in, and store it
	If the user has typed in a "2" (goHigher)
		Find the midway between the current guess and the highest number
		Present guess to the user
		Present prompt to user (“Enter 1 if this was a correct guess, 2 if your number is higher, and 3 if your number is lower:”)
	Else if the user has typed in a "3" (goLower)
		Find the midway between the current guess and the lowest number
		Present guess to the user
		Present prompt to user (“Enter 1 if this was a correct guess, 2 if your number is higher, and 3 if your number is lower:”
	Else if user has typed in a "1" (correct)
		Set boolean value (correctGuess) to true
		Print tries to user
	Increment counter by 1
